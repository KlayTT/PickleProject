### About the Project
- Pickle Place is a user integrative, dynamic single page form site that also allows users to create post, create a profile, and have their own Pickle Avatar.
- This project is my front end capstone and it was designed to have a place for users to store their rare pickles, pickle accessories, and just pickles the users want to save and store to go back to in the future.
- The idea behind creating this app was just to make something that people would have fun using and interacting with other users looking for rare pickles.
